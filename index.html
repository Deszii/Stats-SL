            <p>Stats SL has handed over the Preliminary Report of the Final Census Results to His Excellency the President of the Republic of Sierra Leone, 
                Dr Julius Maada Bio at State House in Freetown.
            <br>
                In his opening remarks, Mr Moses Williams, Chairman of Stats SL Council thanked and heaped praise on the World Bank,
                 UNFPA, UNICEF, UNECA and the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), as critical partners who supported the census process. 
                 Mr. Williams also noted the contribution of the Government of Sierra Leone who came in at the nick of time and ensured the census went ahead. 
                 He recognised the contributions of the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development and the Ministry of Finance.
                <br>
                Making a statement, the Minister of Planning and Economic Development, 
                Dr Francis Kai-Kai, whose ministry supervises Stats SL, 
                reiterated the key objectives of the 2021 mid-term census, especially to correct the technical anomalies of the 2015 census which he said had constrained Stats SL to respond to the basic data needs of various users.
                 He ended by emphasizing that the census met its desired purpose: 
                  “Your excellency, I am pleased to report that all the stated objectives of the Mid Term Census were achieved”,
                   he concluded.</p>
